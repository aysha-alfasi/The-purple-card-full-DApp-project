# The Purple Card <💜💭/>

Capture every fleeting thought on a purple card so it doesn't get lost and can come true one day!💡💜 

The app is built on **React** for the frontend, with some magical backend logic using **Motoko** on **DFINITY's Internet Computer** 🧠💻

Before this full-stack DApp came together, I first built the frontend with **React**. Check out the **exciting phases** of the frontend development in my [React Frontend Repository](https://github.com/aysha-alfasi/The-purple-card-frontend/commits/master/)🎨. That’s where the journey began!

In this repo, you’re exploring the full-stack experience! 🌟
